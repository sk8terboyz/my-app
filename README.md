Created by Shane Kennedy using the `ReactJS Tutorial` (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## `How to run`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
